Example usage
-------------
```
#include "nonstd/observer_ptr.h"

using namespace nonstd;

void use( observer_ptr<int> p )
{
    assert( *p == 42 );
}

int main()
{
    int a = 42;
    observer_ptr<int> p( &a );
    use( p );
}
```

### Compile and run

```
prompt>g++ -std=c++03 -Wall -I../include -o 01-basic.exe 01-basic.cpp && 01-basic.exe
```

In a nutshell
-------------
**observer-ptr** is an implementation of the *world’s dumbest smart pointer* for C++98 and higher. It takes no ownership responsibility for the object it *observes* or *watches* and is intended as a near drop-in replacement for raw pointer types. As a vocabulary type it indicates intended use, easing code reading ([Note 1](#note1)).

Class template `observer_ptr<>` has been proposed for and accepted into C++17 [1][2].

The *observer-ptr* of this project can be used with probably any clang, g++ or MSVC compiler. It has been tested with clang 3.4, g++ 5.2 and with VC6 (VS6, no comparison of observers), VC8 (VS2005), VC10 (VS2010), VC11 (VS2012), VC12 (VS2013), VC14 (VS2015).

License
-------
*observer-ptr* uses the [MIT](LICENSE) license.
 

Dependencies
------------
*observer-ptr* has no other dependencies than the [C++ standard library](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header).


Installation
------------
*observer-ptr* is a single-file header-only library. Put [observer_ptr.h](include/nonstd/observer_ptr.h) in the [include](include) folder directly into the project source tree or somewhere reachable from your project.


Building the tests
------------------
To build the tests you need:

- [CMake](http://cmake.org), version 2.8.7 or later to be installed and in your PATH.
- A [suitable compiler](#reported-to-work-with). 

The [*lest* test framework](https://github.com/martinmoene/lest)  is included in the [test folder](test).
 
The following steps assume that the [*observer-ptr* source code](https://github.com/martinmoene/observer-ptr) has been cloned into a directory named `c:\observer-ptr`.

1. Create a directory for the build outputs for a particular architecture.  
Here we use c:\observer-ptr\build-win-x86-vc10.

        cd c:\observer-ptr
        md build-win-x86-vc10
        cd build-win-x86-vc10

2. Configure CMake to use the compiler of your choice (run `cmake --help` for a list).

        cmake -G "Visual Studio 10 2010" ..

3. Build the test suite in the Debug configuration (alternatively use Release).    

        cmake --build . --config Debug

4. Run the test suite.    

        ctest -V -C Debug

All tests should pass, indicating your platform is supported and you are ready to use *observer-ptr*.


Synopsis

**Contents**  
- [Configuration macros](#configuration-macros)
- [Feature selection macros](#feature-selection-macros)

### Configuration macros

\-D<b>nop\_CONFIG\_CONFIRMS\_COMPILATION\_ERRORS</b>=0  
Define this macro to 1 to experience the by-design compile-time errors of the *observer-ptr* components in the test suite. Default is 0.

### Feature selection macros

\-D<b>nop\_FEATURE\_ALLOW\_IMPLICIT\_CONVERSION</b>=0  
The `observer_ptr` from the C++17 draft provides [explicit conversions](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/explicit) to `bool` and to the underlying type. Explicit conversion is not available from pre-C++11 compilers. To prevent problems due to unexpected [implicit conversions](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/implicit_cast) to `bool` or to the underlying type, this library does not provide these implicit conversions at default. If you still want them, define this macro to 1. Without these implicit conversions enabled, a conversion to bool via the [safe bool idiom](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/More_C%2B%2B_Idioms/Safe_bool) is provided. Default is 0.


Other open source implementations
---------------------------------
None known.

### Notes
<a id="note1"></a>Note 1. This conclusion may be challenged if the coding style ensures that *any raw pointer* is a *non-owning pointer.*
